  Plugin for spec-first development workflow with research, specification authoring,
  review gates, and verification.
---

Spec-Driven Development is a skill-first plugin for spec-first development workflow in the Sinon universal marketplace.

## Purpose

Provide reusable spec-driven development guidance that remains portable across Claude Code and Codex-style plugin systems.

## Included Skill

- `spec-driven-development`: research unknowns, author SPEC.md, pass review gates, implement against approved spec, verify completeness.

## How the Skill Branches

Use `spec-driven-development` when the user explicitly asks to follow a spec-first workflow, write a SPEC.md before implementing, create a specification, or use a spec-first approach.

- `references/workflow.md` — full stage model, approval gates, review loops, and lifecycle semantics.
- `references/spec-authoring-guide.md` — writing or revising `SPEC.md` content.
- `references/research-authoring-guide.md` — writing or revising `RESEARCH.md`.
- `references/linking-guide.md` — editing `call` relationships or checking dependencies.
- `references/review-checklist.md` — Spec Review and Implementation Review.

## Runtime Model

This plugin uses one shared plugin root with two runtime manifests:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`

The actual reusable content lives beside those manifests at the plugin root.

## Shipped Surfaces

- The plugin ships one reusable skill under `skills/`.
- `agents/` contains the Claude-facing agent trigger surface.
- `skills/spec-driven-development/agents/openai.yaml` contains skill-local OpenAI metadata.
- `skills/spec-driven-development/scripts/sdd.sh` is the single CLI entrypoint; it dispatches all SDD subcommands (`validate`, `list-frontmatter`, `get-frontmatter`, `generate-diagram`, `list-tags`) via `uvx` against the bundled `sdd` Python package.
- `assets/templates/` contains scaffolds for SPEC.md, RESEARCH.md, CONTRACT.md, CHANGELOG.md, and openapi.yaml.
- `assets/schemas/` contains JSON Schema definitions for frontmatter validation.

## Design Principles

- Prefer one coherent user job per skill.
- Keep the common path self-sufficient inside `SKILL.md` and move only additive depth into `references/`.
- Derive spec content from requirements, not from implementation.
- Keep manifests aligned with the actual shipped runtime surface.

## Offline-Capable Runtime

The packaged skill is usable offline only when [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is installed and the Python interpreter plus required dependency/build artifacts are already cached or otherwise available locally.
`skills/spec-driven-development/scripts/sdd.sh` invokes the bundled Python package through `uvx --from "${script_dir}"`, which resolves the local `pyproject.toml` and runs the `sdd` console script.
If uv must download Python, dependency metadata, dependencies, or build artifacts, network access may be required unless those inputs are already cached.

Maintainers update the runtime by editing the Python sources under `skills/spec-driven-development/scripts/sdd/` and the accompanying `pyproject.toml`.

## Installation

When this plugin is published in the Sinon marketplace, install it with:

```bash
/plugin install spec-driven-development@sinon
```

For current local development:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/sinon/plugins/spec-driven-development
```

Codex-facing marketplace metadata ships through `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, but it points to the same shared `skills/` content at this plugin root.

## Scope Notes

This plugin focuses on spec-first development workflow guidance. It does not cover:

- Git branch management
- CI/CD pipeline design
- General project management or task tracking
